## Introduction

Welcome to **AkiraOS**! AkiraOS is a basic, open-source operating system designed to be a simple and minimalistic platform for learning and experimentation. Our goal is to build an OS from scratch that can be extended and improved by the community.

## Goals

- **Simplicity**: Focus on fundamental OS principles with a straightforward design.
- **Educational**: Provide a learning platform for those interested in OS development.
- **Community-Driven**: Encourage contributions and collaboration from developers worldwide.

## Current Status

AkiraOS is in the early stages of development. Here's what we have so far:
- Initial repository setup
- Basic project structure
- Preliminary bootloader
